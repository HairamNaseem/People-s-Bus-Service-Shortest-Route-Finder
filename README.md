# People-s-Bus-Service-Shortest-Route-Finder
Peoples Bus Service Karachi Pakistan shortest route finder through Dijktra's algorithm in Java language 

Introduction:
We will be making a system which will tell the shortest route for your destination according to the People’s Bus Service Karachi routes by applying Dijkstra’s algorithm studied in Discrete Structures.
Data Structures topics used:
•	Array List
•	LinkedList
•	Stack
•	HashMap
•	Graph
•	The array data structure is implemented using ArrayList class which is a resizable array.It stores data in contiguous memory locations.
•	Hashmap data structure is used to store key-value pairs.
•	The stack data structure required by the algorithm is implemented using linked list.It follows the principle Last In First Out(LIFO)
•	Heap is implemented with the help of ArrayList and HashMap.It is a tree based data structure where all elements of the tree are in a particular order.
•	Graph is a complex data structure containing vertices and edges connecting these vertices.This is implemented in the project with the help of ArrayList and HashMap.

Features:
The idea is implemented using Graph and Heap data structures. The graph has nodes and edges. Nodes represent a Bus Stop that will be containing certain information regarding that Stop like its name, and the roads which it connects. Edges (the connection between two nodes) represent the distance between the two Bus Stops and the cost of each edge will be equal to the distance between the two of its connecting bus stops(nodes).

Tools and Technologies used:
Programming language used is java
Operating system used is windows
